## Predicting satellite communications capacity with Amazon Forecast

### Description
This repository contains sample code to demonstrate Satellite Communications Forecasting use-cases.

It focuses on a Maritime shipping use-case, using Amazon Forecast to build a time
series predictor model for each satellite beam in the ship(s) path, accounting for the impact of weather
conditions in a given location. It then renders results in Amazon QuickSight BI tooling, displaying
forecasted capacity needs, accuracy metrics, and which attributes most impact the model.
