## Satellite Capacity chatbot

### Description
The Satellite Capacity bot is a chatbot which either returns a satellite capacity forecast, or provides targeted responses 
to satellite related questions, depending on the userâ€™s input questions. 

The bot is intended to show customers how they can (a) get inference results from a SageMaker endpoint in an
easy to use interface i.e. a chatbot, (b) integrate Bedrock Knowledgebase agents to existing applications to 
retrieve answers to domain-specific questions. 

This sub-project is associated with the blog [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/maximizing-satellite-communications-usage-with-amazon-forecast/).
It focuses on a Maritime shipping use-case, 
using [Amazon SageMaker Autopilot Timer-series](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/timeseries-forecasting-deploy-models.html) to build 
a time series predictor model for each satellite beam in the ship(s) path, accounting for the impact of weather
conditions in a given location. It then renders results in [Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/) BI tooling, displaying
forecasted capacity needs, accuracy metrics, and which attributes most impact the model.

### Architecture
The architecture of the system is as follows: -
